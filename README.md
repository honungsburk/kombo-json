# kombo-json

A JSON parser that is built on top of [Kombo](https://github.com/honungsburk/kombo), a parser combinator library.

## Goals

For most purposes, I recommend using javascript's built-in JSON parser (`JSON.parse`) but if you need better error messages this library could be of interest to you.
